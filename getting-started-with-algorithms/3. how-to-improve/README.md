## How to improve

Many people will "get" algorithms conceptually, but will struggle with coding them. This is usually a sign that they struggle with creating a set of unambiguous steps; they aren't skilled in translating algorithms into code.

The best way to master this skill is to practice, a LOT!

When I was in college and I wanted to get really good at TopCoder, Google Code Jam, etc, I started doing practice problems all the time. Like, 4+hrs a day, every day. I would code between classes at the comp lab. I would code after work. I would code before bed. My roommate, who didn't code, probably knew more about algorithms than any sane non-programmer should. As a result, I improved a lot over a short period of time. If you want to get skilled at this, you are going to need to practice a lot.

This whole first module focuses on simpler algorithms, but the actual algorithms are often silly in their simplicity.

The goal of this first module is to teach you to practice so that you can improve quickly and efficiently. This will be necessary to get through all the later modules.
