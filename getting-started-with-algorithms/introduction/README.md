## Why should I learn algorithms

Truthfully, you likely won't ever need to use half (or more) of the algorithms
you learn about here in the real world.

The real goal here is practice taking an idea and translating it into code.

**Other reasons include...**

You WILL need to come up with your algorithms to tackle your own custom problems, and having a basic understanding of how algorithms work can help.

It is useful to understand time complexity, and this is usually taught with algorithms.

Interviews often use quiz problems that are much easier after diving into algorithms like the ones we cover in this course.

Algorithms really can be fun if we stop focusing on the boring parts!

### Course format 

In order to learn, we typically follow the following format:

1. Learn about an algorithm
2. Look at a practice problem and code a solution

Sometimes we will look at multiple practice problems. Sometimes we will look at problems that look nothing like the algorithm we learned so you can see how it isn't always obvious what algorithms can be applied to solve a problem.

But in this first module we will have a few videos where I cover some basic background information that I think might be useful before diving in.
