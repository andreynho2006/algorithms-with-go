They are just some rules to solve a problem.

The hard part is defining rules that are not ambiguous, when we are so used to instructions being ambiguous because we humans can infer a lot.

**Recipe to cook something**

- What is a "pinch of salt"?
- What exactly does sauteing something entail?
- What is "tender" in "cook until tender"?
- Do we have to inform people to get things out of the fridge? To crack their eggs? How fast to stir the pot?
